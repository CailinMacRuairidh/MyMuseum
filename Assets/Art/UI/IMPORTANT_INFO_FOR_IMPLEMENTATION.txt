- All "Backdrop Boxes" (e.g. "GUI2_ArtefactBrowser6_BackdropBox1",
  "GUI2_ArtefactInspector1_InspectorBoxBackdrop1", "GUI1_CameraRotate1_BoxBackdrop1", etc) are half the
  size they should be (because it seems stupidly inefficient to export a blank backdrop image bigger than
  2000x2000px), so be sure to scale them up by 2 when putting them in-engine.
