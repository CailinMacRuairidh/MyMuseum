  ArtefactContent: 'This toilet seat was found during the 1979 excavations in Kirk
    Close, Perth. It was found resting on a timber frame over a cesspit.  Evidence
    suggests that the structure had been reduced in size and that originally there
    may have been two seats. Toilet seats such as this were common across a broad
    time range: some were still being used in outside toilets in the 19th century.
    Similar medieval examples have been excavated in York, Kings Lynn and Exeter.'
