  ArtefactContent: Born in Southampton, Millais studied at the Royal Academy Schools
    in London. He became associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. So his work
    came to the attention of their early champion John Ruskin, the most influential
    art critic in England. The picture is one of a pair, the other is titled Asleep.
    The title of this one may suggest a wider wakening as the girl grows up, hence
    the discarded books and toys of childhood, above all, the open doored, empty
    birdcage above her head at which she gazes. The picture is highly detailed in
    its technique.
