  ArtefactContent: Cameron was the son of a former Perth minister and took a great
    interest in the opening of the new Perth Art Gallery & Museum in 1935. During
    his lifetime he made many gifts to the collection and after his death in Perth
    in 1945 he divided his estate between the National Gallery of Scotland and Perth
    Art Gallery & Museum. Cameron had begun as an etcher, producing over 300 known
    plates. He was a skilled watercolourist and became a prolific recorder of the
    Scottish landscape in his oil paintings. Here he paints a typically broody, almost
    menacing view of Glencoe with its association of slaughter in the 1692 Massacre.
