  ArtefactContent: McCulloch was inspired by Sir Walter Scott's poem of 1810, The
    Lady of the Lake. The Loch nestles at the heart of one of the most popular and
    beautiful of all Scotland's tourist haunts, The Trossachs to the west of Callendar.
    Not only does it now serve the people of Glasgow as one of its reservoirs, it
    is also home to a paddle steamer pleasure boat, the PS Sir Walter Scott. The
    works of Scott proved immensely inspirational to Scottish and other artists throughout
    the 19th century. His interest in places steeped in Scottish history touched
    a nerve with a nation that was striving to establish its own cultural foundations
    across the arts in the 1800s and helped open up the Scottish highlands as the
    first seeds of the tourist trade were sown.
